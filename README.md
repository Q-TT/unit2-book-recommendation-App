### Project Choice: 
Book Recommendation App

### Project Inspriation: 
As a user, I always have trouble with finding good books and the pdf resources for the boooks I'm interested. So I decided to developed an app for myself. This app will provided pdf resources based on keyword searching. It will also share other people's recommendations on books as well as making your own booklist.

### Project Description:
An app that allows you to find download resources, make a post on recommending or criticizing a book and browse other people’s recommendations or critics.

### Key Features:
#### Search:
This app will allow gest or AUU users input keywords and the return a list of books'name contains the keywords. For each book, we wll have **Name, Author, Publish date, Category, Description**, and most importantly **PDF link** provided for users.

#### Make post:
This app will also allow gest or AUU users to browse other people's posts, and will allow AUU users to make a booklist saved at their account and posted to the public. So that they can have access to their own booklist as well as see other people's recommendations. They can thumb-up or thumb-down on pther people's posts if they want.
